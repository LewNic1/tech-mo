# **TechMo -TechMoms,TechMore**

## **Project Inspiration**
Techmo was inspired by my experiences at General Assembly Web Immersion Bootcamp. Trying to balance being a student and motherhood, I found out the struggle is real, REAL quick! The struggle motivated me to create a platform where moms in tech bootcamps and also seasonsed moms working in Tech can join forces to create community in sharing resources, creating study groups, network or even enjoy a happy hour. Working along side other moms who are going through the same struggles provides a sense of hope and motivation to keep pushing through.

## **App Summary**
### Who is the user?
The users of TechMo are women/moms (of any age and background) in tech bootcamps or working in the tech industry who are interested in building community, support and network.
### What can users do?
A user can sign up for a TechMo account, creating their profile and post resources of any type technical or non-technical for the Techmo community. The user can then save resources to their profiles to keep in their account. The user can also edit their profile if needed.
